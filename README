jquery-adjustToWindow is a jQuery plugin to set elements dimensions according to window dimensions.

USAGE
You need to specify the data-width and data-height attributes in the element to be resized and then call $(selector).adjustToWindow(options).

OPTIONS
Currently, you can only select if the element shall be centralized vertically and/or horizontally, passing an options object.

centralizeW: true;
centralizeH: true;

PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
* Provide an options to specify an offset from all sides (top, right, bottom and left);
* User-specified sources for originalWidth and originalHeight of the element (not only data-width and data-height);
* Allow centralizing without image cuts (HTML based resize).
